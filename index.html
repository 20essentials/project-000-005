      <h2>Whose is the name? </h2>
      <p>Negan, a character from "The Walking Dead" TV series, is a charismatic yet brutal leader of the Saviors, a
        ruthless group of survivors. Portrayed by Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Negan wields a barbed-wire-wrapped baseball bat
        named Lucille, using it to enforce his iron-fisted rule. Initially introduced as an antagonist, his violent and
        unpredictable nature instills fear and submission among other survivor communities. Despite his cruelty, Negan
        is complex, exhibiting moments of unexpected kindness and moral conflict. His dynamic personality and intricate
        backstory, including the loss of his wife Lucille to cancer, add depth to his character. Over time, Negan's
        journey shifts, exploring themes of redemption and transformation, making him one of the most compelling and
        multifaceted characters in the series.</p>

      <h2>Programmer in W3C</h2>
      <p>
        Douglas Engelbart, born in 1925, was a pioneering computer scientist whose work in the 1960s transformed
        computing. At the Stanford Research Institute, he developed the oN-Line System (NLS), introducing revolutionary
        concepts like the graphical user interface (GUI), hypertext, and networked computers. His most famous invention,
        the computer mouse, patented in 1970, fundamentally changed human-computer interaction. Engelbart's 1968 "Mother
        of All Demos" showcased these innovations, including real-time text editing, video conferencing, and
        collaborative work. His visionary contributions laid the groundwork for modern personal computing, influencing
        how we interact with technology daily. Engelbart passed away in 2013, but his legacy lives on through his
        transformative impact on computing.</p>

      <h2>Photographer</h2>
      <p>
        HÃ¥kon Wium Lie, born in 1965 in Norway, is a key yet lesser-known figure in web development history. While
        working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN and later at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), he proposed Cascading
        Style Sheets (CSS) in 1994. This innovation revolutionized web design by separating content from presentation,
        allowing for more flexible and visually appealing websites. Lie's work has significantly influenced modern web
        aesthetics and user experience. Throughout his career, he has championed open web standards and browser
        compatibility. Though not as famous as Berners-Lee, Lie's contributions to CSS are fundamental to the web's
        evolution, making him a pivotal figure in the history of web development.</p>
